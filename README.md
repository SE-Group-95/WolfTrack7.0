### Third-Party Tools

- [SQLite 3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)

  SQLite is often used with Flask due to its simplicity, lightweight nature, and compatibility with Flask applications. Here's why it's commonly used:

  - **Easy Setup**: SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration database engine. It doesn't require a separate server process to be running. For small to medium-sized applications, this ease of setup and use can be beneficial.

  - **No Configuration**: As SQLite doesn't require configuration or maintenance of a separate server, it's convenient for development environments and smaller-scale applications. In Flask, SQLite can be used with minimal setup.

  - **Portability**: SQLite databases are stored as a single file. This makes them highly portable and easy to transfer or share among different environments or applications.

  - **Suitability for Prototyping and Small Projects**: For early stages of development, when the emphasis might be on rapidly prototyping an application or for smaller projects with relatively lower data requirements, SQLite can be a good choice due to its simplicity.

  - **Flask Integration**: Flask has built-in support for SQLite. The sqlite3 module is included in Python's standard library, allowing Flask applications to interact with SQLite databases seamlessly.


- [JSearch](https://www.openwebninja.com/api/jsearch)

  JSearch by OpenWeb Ninja is a fast, reliable, and comprehensive jobs API. As the most comprehensive and maintained option available, JSearch empowers you to seamlessly access most-up-to-date job postings and salary information in real-time from Google for Jobs - the largest job aggregate on the web.

- [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/signup/)

  OpenAI's API enables AI-driven capabilities for applications like natural language processing and machine learning.
